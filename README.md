# NG-CHM
The NG-CHM Heat Map Viewer is a dynamic, graphical environment for exploration of clustered or
non-clustered heat map data in a web browser.
It supports zooming, panning, searching, covariate bars, and link-outs
that enable deep exploration of patterns and associations in heat maps.

The project [homepage](http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/NG-CHM-V2:Overview)
includes additional documentation, introductory videos, and tutorials.
